'''how to set window-properties''' <br>
one could set windowproperties by 3 different ways: 1. define at startup, eg xterm -geometry 10x50 2. using the application-setting-mechanism of fluxbox, read the manpage, chapter applications settings for more information. 3. setting it after creation by using "xwit", available at ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/xwit-3.4.tar.gz .

'''imlib2''' <br>
the lib you need to have when you want to use .png .jpg and otheir formats, inside of fluxbox (in the style or the menu). To get it you have to recompile fluxbox, and remember to ./configure --enable-imlib2 (or get a package that has it enabled). You can check if you already have with it `fluxbox -i` (if its not there at all, then you need a newer version of fluxbox).

'''import''' <br>
The magic almighty "import" command is part of ImageMagick. To take a screenshot with it, try 'import -w root screen.jpg'.
