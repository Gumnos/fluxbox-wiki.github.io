<h2 id="what-is-typeahead">What is typeahead?</h2>
<p>Typeahead is a feature, in which you start typing a word (like a menuitem, or for a link in webpage) and the system finds the first occurence of that word. This is already implemented in Firefox and many other programs. And now it's in <a href="http://www.fluxbox.org/">Fluxbox</a></p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-use-it">How do I use it?</h2>
<p>People using mostly keyboard benefit the most from typeahead. In fluxbox, currently the menu has a typeahead feature, incoming is focusing windows with typing their title.</p>
<p>So, you open the menu, and start typing the item you want, let's say &quot;Applications&quot;. You should see the word(s) getting underlined. If there is multiple items with same kind of name, you can switch between them by pressing <strong>tab</strong>. <strong>Shift + tab</strong> goes other way around.</p>
<p>If you mistype a word, <strong>backspace</strong> erases characters back to where it matches other items. So not just 1 character, but to a point when there was multiple matches. When pressing <strong>backspace</strong> with no selection (nothing underlined) the current submenu gets closed.</p>
<p><strong>Enter</strong> opens a submenu or executes the item/application selected.</p>
<p>To close all menus, press <strong>esc</strong>.</p>
