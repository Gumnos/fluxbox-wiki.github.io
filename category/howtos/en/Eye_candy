Fluxbox is a simple window manager, meaning that by default there is not much decoration.

== Start ==
*[[howto rounded corners|rounded corners]] 
*[[howto remove window decor|borderless windows]] - useful for terminals
*[[Background|transparency]] - allows transparency on borders and the menu
**[[Transparency|true transparency]] - using xcompmgr
*[[howto edit menu|add icons to your menu]]

To display some nice details about your computer, memory usage etc. use [http://conky.sourceforge.net/ Conky] or  [http://torsmo.sourceforge.net/ torsmo] that show the info over the background image (the '''root window'''). You can also use [http://members.dslextreme.com/users/billw/gkrellm/gkrellm.html GKrellm] that will go nicely to the slit when launching like '''gkrellm -w'''.

Other nice eye candy things are [http://gdesklets.gnomedesktop.org/ GDesklets] and [http://adesklets.sourceforge.net/ ADesklets] that allow you to have almost anything on your dekstop. Anything from launcbars to weather forecasts and tv programs lists. You can also get a floating duck with [http://www.ne.jp/asahi/linux/timecop/ bubblemon].
