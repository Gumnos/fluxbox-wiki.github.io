==Where to get styles==
* [http://tenr.de/ Tenr.de] - Tenner has many very good styles, and makes them all the time. Check his site often
* [http://box-look.org/index.php?xcontentmode=7400 box-look.org] - Also styles for other boxes
* [http://customize.org/fluxbox Customize.org] - Haven't checked this one yet, looks quite promising
* [http://klowner.com/themes/ Klowner] - Klowner has some 6 quite nice styles

==Install styles==
In order to install them, download and extract the tar archive in your ~/.fluxbox/styles directory. <br>
Then you'll find them in your Fluxbox menu under the <code>styles</code> entry.
