<h3 id="dont-ask-to-ask">Don't ask to ask</h3>
<p>Do not ask if anyone can help you or if you're allowed to ask a question. Just ask and wait. This is freenode, so don't expect people to be available 24/7; they will answer when back from lunch or someone else helps you out. #fluxbox is a community driven channel.</p>
<h3 id="add-as-much-relevant-information-as-you-can-provide">Add as much relevant information as you can provide</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explain your problem properly (&quot;my fluxbox looks strange&quot; is not a proper description)</li>
<li>State your version of fluxbox (not just &quot;the latest&quot;; state the correct version ['fluxbox -v' is the command you need])</li>
<li>State your GNU/Linux distro</li>
<li>Tell if you installed fluxbox via your distro's package manager (apt-get, RPM etc.) or if you built it by hand</li>
<li>Tell the WHOLE error message if you received any</li>
<li>Tell any relevant information about your environment that seem to be related (UTF-8, xinerama, etc)</li>
<li>Did you change/update anything that seems related to your problem[s]?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="explain-what-you-did">Explain what you did</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have you changed any file[s]?</li>
<li>Have you updated/deleted/installed anything?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="be-polite">Be polite</h3>
<p>You are searching for help, people are trying to help you for free. Keep that in mind.</p>
<h3 id="dont-repeat-yourself">Don't repeat yourself</h3>
<p>No one responding is not a bad sign. Maybe you just entered the channel to a wrong time. So ask and wait, someone will read it and give you an aswer. Even though that anser might take some time. Remember you're on freenode. Stay and wait if you have the chance.</p>
<h3 id="answer-the-questions-people-ask-you">Answer the questions people ask you</h3>
<p>Some might need additional informations to help you and you should offer them, so listen closely.</p>
<h3 id="read-the-manuals-and-the-wiki">READ THE MANUALS AND THE WIKI</h3>
<p>People might direct you to the wiki and/or to the manual, so do what they tell you and go and read. Don't expect anyone to spoon-feed you.</p>
<h3 id="do-not-flood-the-channel---use-a-pastebin">Do not flood the channel - use a pastebin</h3>
