How can I help this wiki
------------------------

There are several things you can do to help. We would like to have the
[Howtos](:Category:Howtos "wikilink") page, and [FAQs](faqs "wikilink")
page translated to as many languages as possible so we can provide
support to as many users all over the world as possible.

We are currently moving to using the Category tags on the wiki to help
organize things. Links to the [old how to page](howtos "wikilink") are
being removed as often as possible. If your language is not on [this
page](:Category:Howtos "wikilink") then you need to make sure its added
by using the Category tags in the content. If you need help doing this
please look at how we have the section done, or contact me at
`errr [AT] errr-online [DOT] com`.

How can I help fluxbox
----------------------

Because fluxbox is under constant development, the community can always
be helped with bug reports concearning the current development versions.
Such bug reports should consist of information about your system
including your fluxbox version, a way to reproduce the bug, and your
contact information (if everything else is well written you can pretty
much skip the contact stuff). Such bugreports should be submitted to
[sourceforge.net](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=35398&atid=413960).
