What is typeahead?
------------------

Typeahead is a feature, in which you start typing a word (like a
menuitem, or for a link in webpage) and the system finds the first
occurence of that word. This is already implemented in Firefox and many
other programs. And now it's in [Fluxbox](http://www.fluxbox.org/)

How do I use it?
----------------

People using mostly keyboard benefit the most from typeahead. In
fluxbox, currently the menu has a typeahead feature, incoming is
focusing windows with typing their title.

So, you open the menu, and start typing the item you want, let's say
"Applications". You should see the word(s) getting underlined. If there
is multiple items with same kind of name, you can switch between them by
pressing **tab**. **Shift + tab** goes other way around.

If you mistype a word, **backspace** erases characters back to where it
matches other items. So not just 1 character, but to a point when there
was multiple matches. When pressing **backspace** with no selection
(nothing underlined) the current submenu gets closed.

**Enter** opens a submenu or executes the item/application selected.

To close all menus, press **esc**.
