### How to work the bots

The main bot in the room is fbot. When fbot is on holiday or what ever,
computer is there as a backup. Both bots have very similar syntax. To
ask them a question address them:

`fb0t: styles?`

fbot will respond with a list of websites that you can visit to download
new styles. That syntax is identical for computer, and in most cases
fbot and computer give the same info, but in other cases they do not.
You can also use:

` ,styles?`

and this will trigger fbot but not computer to avoid being flooded by
bots. computers trigger for not addressing it is:

` 'styles`

fbot has a handy search feature that computer did not have, if you are
looking for things fbot knows about startup but aren't sure of the
keyword, you can use:

` fb0t: keyword search background`

and fbot will give you a list of keywords with 'background' in their
name. Additionally you can address the bots in a private message.

### Broken links or Out of date Info

If something fbot or computer tells you is a broken or dead link, or the
info is just totally wrong, please inform someone in the room who can
correct it; like errr, hnaz, dopey, meltir, or one of the
[developers](http://fluxbox-wiki.org/index.php/Faqs#Who_are_the_developers)
