First, install wmctrl either from your distribution's package manager or get the source [http://sweb.cz/tripie/utils/wmctrl/ here]. Next, download [http://mark.tiefenbruck.org/fluxbox/scripts/next_desktop.pl this perl script].  The script has the following syntax:
[[Category:English howtos]]
[[Category:Misc howtos]]
perl next_desktop.pl [up|down|left|right [# [0]]]

* up|down|left|right is the direction to move: default right
* "#" stands for the number of workspaces to move: default 1
* 0 indicates that the script should not wrap around the grid to change workspaces

Inside the script, there are some other configuration variables for setting how many rows and columns to use. You may set them, but if you leave them alone, the script will try to guess your layout based on the number of workspaces you have.  This should result in the desired behavior in most cases.

Now, when you want to change desktops, use this script instead of the built-in commands.
