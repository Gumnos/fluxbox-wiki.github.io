### How to lock the screen

Locking the screen means that nobody can use the computer without giving your password first. You need some locking programs. here are some

-   [alock](http://darkshed.net/projects/alock)
-   [xlock / xlockmore](http://www.tux.org/~bagleyd/xlockmore.html)
-   [slock](http://tools.suckless.org/slock)

Then just add an entry for those in your menu or add a keybinding or even an icon with idesk or fbdesk.

Please note though that Linux/unix/bsd is multi-users system so someone else may come, switch to other console (ctrl + alt + f?) and then enter his/her username and password and use the computer. He/she cannot access your files or running programs. If you don't like this behaviour, get something like [vlock](http://freecode.com/projects/vlock), or try [VT-Switch-Loker](https://github.com/MatenViro/vt-switch-locker) project.

### A screensaver?

You need some program for screensavers too...

-   [xscreensaver](http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/)
-   [xlockmore](http://www.tux.org/~bagleyd/xlockmore.html)
-   [gnome-screensaver](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeScreensaver)
-   [really slick screensavers](http://www.reallyslick.com/)
-   [Really Slick Screensavers Port to GLX](http://rss-glx.sourceforge.net/)
-   [electricsheep](http://electricsheep.org/)

These have a but different behaviours. For example, xlockmore launches the screensaver when you launch the program. So you need an icon/menuitem/keybind for it. XScreensaver runs on background (add it to **\~/.fluxbox/startup**) and after a certain amount of idling launches the screensaver.

There are several lock utilities that launch xscreensaver when you lock, these include [XScreenSaver.App](http://xscreensaverapp.sourceforge.net/) and [GkrellShoot](http://gkrellshoot.sourceforge.net/)
