Do not use fluxconf!
--------------------

[fluxconf](http://devaux.fabien.free.fr/flux/) was a tool to configure fluxbox's init file, edit the menu and the keys file. It is now so old that it *will* break your init file, menu, and keys file. Most modern distributions have removed this tool from their repositories.

A nifty alternative to the menu configurator is Zan's [fluxMenu application](http://fluxmenu.berlios.de/) (last updated 2007, current state unknown).

Most of the options that are set in the init file are configured via the config part of the rootmenu.
