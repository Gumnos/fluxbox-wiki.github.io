Where to get styles
-------------------

-   [Tenr.de](http://tenr.de/) - Tenner has many very good styles, and makes them all the time. Check his site often
-   [box-look.org](http://box-look.org/index.php?xcontentmode=7400) - Also styles for other boxes
-   [Customize.org](http://customize.org/fluxbox) - Haven't checked this one yet, looks quite promising
-   [Klowner](http://klowner.com/themes/) - Klowner has some 6 quite nice styles

Install styles
--------------

In order to install them, download and extract the tar archive in your \~/.fluxbox/styles directory.
Then you'll find them in your Fluxbox menu under the `styles` entry.
